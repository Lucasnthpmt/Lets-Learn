# Let's-Learn

## Goals:

Let's Learn's goals are to compile multiple teaching sources of various languages and to teach people through code and its comments how to code in their desired language.
The project is currently at its infancy and only two people working on it, focusing on the language Go.
As time goes on, i want this repo to acquire as many languages as possible and achieve a great standard in quality, being able to easily teach others.

If you want to participate in the project or make any fixes/implement new modules or languages, i can add you as a collaborator, just send me a message.

The exercises are part of the project but still need to have its structure decided.

Let's Learn is a repo dedicated to teaching others the technologies and languages they want to learn.
